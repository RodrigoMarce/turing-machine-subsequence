# turing-machine-subsequence
This program is an encoding for the Turing machine that gets as input two arbitrary binary strings x
and y separated by the special symbol # and accepts if and only if x is a subsequence of y.
|x| â‰¤ |y| is assumed. The program shows the sequence of configurations of the machine when given an example input.
The example input for this program is 00#100.
